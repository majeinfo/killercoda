The "mysqlsrv" Pod implements a MySQL Server.
You have been told that the MySQL root user's password is "password".
The "check-job" described in the "check-job.yml" manifest tries to connect to the MySQL server
but it seems to fail.

Can you fix it ?

Note: the MySQL root password **must be** "password" and **must be** read from a Secret
